Flung some of my websites into the dat/beaker-verse, just to see if I could.

Hello, p2p web ðŸ‘‹

TKTK: I'd like to write more about how to do this for the first time.

TKTK there's a lot of discussion about mirroring but it'd be interesting to serve separate things at the same name on DAT and HTTP, unlike blasting the same thing across protocols (do ppl do this with Tor?)
