# 18-04-18

Setting up my learning site. I generated a default Beaker Website:

<img src="/log/img/18-04-18/Screen Shot 2018-04-18 at 9.17.12 AM.png" title="Beaker's Create New options">

<img title="Hello world!" src="/log/img/18-04-18/Screen Shot 2018-04-18 at 8.38.34 AM.png">

<img title="First Github push" src="/log/img/18-04-18/Screen Shot 2018-04-18 at 8.38.54 AM.png">

I love my automatically generated local workspace name :)

I've adopted it on my real site, calling this my watery-notebook.

It's nice that Beaker also has the option of making a site out of plain markdown files which get rendered in the browser, without even needing to run a site generator.

I filed [a bug](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/956) because I wasn't able to get Beaker to render markdown image tags with relative URLS. (I'm not sure I know what I'm doing enough to be helpful yet though?)

---

I added a nav file, which Beaker includes on every markdown page. And I realized I could also sneakily drop some styles in there to prevent images from rendering up too large.

```
[Home](/)
[Log](/log)

<style>
  img {max-width: 100%;}
</style>
```
