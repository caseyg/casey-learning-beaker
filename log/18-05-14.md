This week I thought about ways to sneak into the Ethereal conference without paying. It seems maybe a little fucked up that it costs over a thousand dollars to attend? It's funny to me that it happens at Knockdown Center. Like, Crypto is "Brooklyn" where Old Money is "Manhattan". Somebody I know hinted that they could put people on the guest list but I never heard back. Another friend forwarded me a volunteer opportunity, but I couldn't stomach volunteering for 6 hours at what is basically a conference about money.

Gary organized for a few people from Orbital's #decentralization Slack channel to get together, share interests, and chat.

Gary presented first, on NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).

Fungible tokens are what most people associate with "Bitcoin" and cryptocurrency. For example: if we want to do an equal exchange, I can give you one unit, and you can give me any comparable unit (it doesn't have to be the same exact one I gave you), and it won't really mean much. These units are also divisible — e.g. we can trade fractions of units.

Non-Fungible Tokens are indivisible and uniquely identified, so we can't trade fractions of them, and if we exchange tokens we each have a different thing.

Gary identified a bunch of possible use cases for NFTs including: diplomas, identifications, deeds (e.g. ownership documents).

Bundling

One example we looked at was Mark Pesce's Attention Token. My question was: why not just use money? Does this really engage the unique properties of cryptocurrency or is it just a gimmick?

Another example is Cryptokitties, which Gary noted made some people annoyed, because they hoped that NFTs would be proved viable by something less silly — but in his opinion you can't determine what will go viral.

Kathleen presented a series of slides titled "ICO (Initial Coin Offering) vs. IPO (Initial Public Offering)".

I am glad I cut my hair last week because these conversations literally make me overheat with frustration.

Talking with Gary, Kathleen, and Brian made me realize I'm coming into these conversations with a very different mindset, ready to roll my eyes at whatever I'm seeing.

experimentation mindset
am i closed? cynical?
who stands to benefit from interdisciplinarity?

It makes me anxious to think of blockchain as
nail for every hammer
hammer for every nail

I think one of the things I am feeling is actually fear.

Why am I afraid of blockchain?

What are the changing stakes?

immutability as

Kathleen and Brian weren't familiar with Beaker so I fired it up and briefly talked about a few of its features.

I referenced this tweet again.

I don't think I made a very good argument for it.

I mentioned a deleted thread on infrastructure/big services and how p2p is only good for art projects and simple communications infrastructure.

I also showed Scuttlebutt

How scuttlebutt is handling edit/delete

cw reverse justification of design decisions

who is making these tools and why?
