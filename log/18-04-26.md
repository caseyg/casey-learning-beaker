Something weird has happened in the past month. Between experimenting with p2p and css grid, I've gone from not even thinking about how much I use Chrome, to using 3 browsers pretty regularly and enjoying each of them for their different strengths and backgrounds.

Also,

I was thinking a lot today about how much I like the idea of self-contained websites, and wondering why the ideas of flat files and no external dependencies (a.k.a. [self-contained websites](18-04-24.md)) are SO appealing to me, just on a technical level.
