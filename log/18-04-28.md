Today I was thinking about dat:// urls, like mine own:

dat://2d038175fbf152b4643739a36617c4ab4677630286da80988043f68b332a1970

What a garble! Even the browser URL bar shortens it for... aesthetic reasons(?), like so:

`dat://2d0381..70`

a.k.a.

`dat://[first 6]..[last 2]`

I was very impressed by the simplicity and ease[^1] of setting up a .well-known "vanity" dat url for my other two sites. And I quite like that dat urls are free, disposable, and don't make me think about what to call things.

I wondered aloud (well, asked)[^2] where beaker gets its local workspace names, which couldn't be more different in character from the 64 character alphanumeric hex codes bestowed upon live sites:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" markdown="1"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/taravancil?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@taravancil</a> do you know how beaker generates local workspace names? e.g. ‚Äúwatery-notebook‚Äù<br><br>(I tried looking around in the code briefly but couldn‚Äôt figure out where this happens.) <br><br>((All the names are so cute, I love them.))</p>&mdash; Casey Gollan (@CaseyG) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyG/status/990421693129809920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2018</a></blockquote>

(Not sure if this was the right place to ask, but I will post here if I hear back!)

I was reminded of my favorite URL shortener, Whistle. One of my favorite pieces of software, really. It is an _algorithmically reversible_ URL shortener.

The problem it solves is this: a regular old url shortener generates urls optimized for being short and unique, if one of these services like tinyurl.com or bit.ly were to go offline, not only would all the URLs routed through them stop working, but unless they released their gigantic databases of millions of concordances of long URLs and short URLs, all the codes would forever lose their meaning and usefulness.

The algorithmically reversible URL shortener still optimizes for shortness and uniqueness, but above all prioritizes arriving at these factors in a way that, in the event of a disaster, could be reverse-engineered without necessarily needing to look up the answer in a database.

I ended up falling into a bit of a wormhole reading about ed25519, the public-key signature system used by dat to generate its URLs:

https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA

and wondering about the relationship between EdDSA and beaker's workspace names, and if there's any possibility to create algorithmically reversible shortcodes for dat URLs. Maybe not, because they don't have any grok-able meaning to grab onto?

[^1]: Well, except for the snafu where Github Pages, where I host my sites, doesn't allow for sites with custom URLs to use HTTPS, but Beaker requires HTTPS for dat discovery, so I had to bump the sites over to Netlify for hosting.

[^2]: For unknown reasons Twitter's embed (but not the linked tweet) is showing a FUTURE DATE here? Spooky... üëª ‚è∞
