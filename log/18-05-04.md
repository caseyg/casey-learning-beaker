Applied to Taeyoon's lectures with Alexander Galloway:

They asked: what does "uncomputable" mean to you?

And I responded:

Without knowing everything, my gut feeling is that the universe isn't computational! I'm reminded of too many things to name in a one line text box. Echoes of N. Katherine Hayles on intermediating cycles through which print becomes an output of digital text, Wendy Chun's writing on spectres and daemons, Marvin Minsky's attempt to reduce thinking to nonthinking in Society of Mind. The first thing that came to mind, though, was a quote I return to a lot: "Communications (plural) are the institutions and forms in which ideas, attitudes, and information are transmitted and received...they might include tombs, hieroglyphics, virtual reality or any other signifying medium. Communication, in contrast, I take as the project of reconciling self and other. The mistake is to think that communications will solve the problem of communication, that better wiring will eliminate the ghosts." (from Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication, John Durham Peters)
