> DAT (dat:// vs. http://) was invented by scientists trying to share large data sets, in order to "torrent" data from each other. Nobody foots a big server bill, and anybody who downloads the data is also helping "seed" it.
>
> Beaker Browser is a way to use DAT to share webpages/folders with each other off of our own computers in a decentralized way. So when I browse "the web" on Beaker, I'm pulling content directly off of the computer of the person who made it and others visiting/seeding that site, not a server farm somewhere.

And obviously it's not all rosy, there are politics/changing stakes here, too. Anyway, I'd love to talk further about this with anybody. Let me know if you wanna chat more.
